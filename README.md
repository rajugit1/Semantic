 Build a RAG System

If you prefer a structured project with a clear starting point, you can build a project in the insurance domain, similar to the project you saw in the ‘Retrieval Augmented Generation’ session. The goal of the project will be to build a robust generative search system capable of effectively and accurately answering questions from various policy documents. You may use LangChain or LlamaIndex to build the generative search application.

Agent Systems

LLMs can be used as building blocks to create reasoning agents very easily with the help of frameworks such as LangChain and LlamaIndex. Here are a couple of project ideas that you can build around the concept of agents:
Conversational agent: Develop a conversational agent that uses LangChain to engage in natural conversations with users, providing information based on the context of the queries.

Data Analytics Agent: Build a Python agent that can perform data analytics on a given data set by converting natural language queries into detailed insights and reports. You can use a pandas-based agent or a CSV agent for creating the data analytics agent system.
SQL Agent: Build an SQL agent that can fetch and analyse information from various databases and perform data retrieval and processing based on the user’s query.
 

As you work on your custom project, remember to document your progress meticulously. Create comprehensive documentation that outlines your project's goals, the model used, data sources, key design decisions and any challenges you encountered.
